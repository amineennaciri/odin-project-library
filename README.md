# odin-project-library
This is the admin project library from TOP(the odin project) Full Stack JavaScript course.

This project is about building a small library app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around JavaScript.

Self-reflection and conclusion:
The project was an excellent opportunity to practice my DOM skills and also my Javascript constructor knowledge.
The project put me on challenges to figure out how to make the form work without a server where to push the data in.
The project was challenging in term of manipulating the DOM to make the change read status button and the delete book from library button.
All of this was great experience, and opportunity for practice.
